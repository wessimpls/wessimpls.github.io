â†’Ionic: </br>
Is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development.</br> The original version was released in 2013 and built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova.</br> The more recent releases, known as Ionic 2 or simply "Ionic", are built on Angular.</br> Ionic provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile apps using</br> Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Sass. Apps can be built with these Web technologies and</br> then distributed through native app stores to be installed on devices by leveraging Cordova.</br> Ionic was created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. in 2013.</br>

Ionic Creator is a drag-and-drop interface building tool.</br>

PhoneGap:</br>
Apache Cordova (formerly PhoneGap) is a mobile application development framework originally</br> created by Nitobi.</br> Adobe Systems purchased Nitobi in 2011, rebranded it as PhoneGap, and later released an open source version of the software called Apache Cordova.</br>Apache Cordova enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript instead of relying on</br> platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phone.</br>It enables wrapping up of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code depending upon the platform of the device.</br>It extends the features of HTML and JavaScript to work with the device.</br>The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because </br>all layout rendering is done via Web views instead of the platform's native UI framework)</br> nor purely Web-based (because they are not just Web apps, but are packaged as apps</br> for distribution and have access to native device APIs).</br> Mixing native and hybrid code snippets has been possible since version 1.9.

The software was previously called just "PhoneGap", then "Apache Callback".</br>As open-source software, Apache Cordova allows wrappers around it, such as Appery.</br>io or Intel XDK.
